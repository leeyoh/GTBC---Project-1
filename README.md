## **Overview**

Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

-If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?

### **Learning Objectives**

*You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:*

-Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

-Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

-Resolve merge conflicts

-Explain agile software development
